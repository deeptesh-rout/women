			<div class="body-text">
				<p>Vera Rubin was an American astronomer who pioneered work on galaxy rotation rates. She uncovered the discrepancy between the predicted angular motion of galaxies and the observed motion, by studying galactic rotation curves. This phenomenon became known as the galaxy rotation problem, and was evidence of the existence of dark matter. Although initially met with skepticism, Rubin's results were confirmed over subsequent decades. Her legacy was described by The New York Times as "ushering in a Copernican-scale change" in cosmological theory.</p>

			<div class="body-text">
				<p>Maria Goeppert Mayer was a German-born American theoretical physicist, and Nobel laureate in Physics for proposing the nuclear shell model of the atomic nucleus. She was the second woman to win a Nobel Prize in physics In 1986, the Maria Goeppert-Mayer Award for early-career women physicists was established in her honor.</p>
				<p>She developed a mathematical model for the structure of nuclear shells, for which she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963, which she shared with J. Hans D. Jensen and Eugene Wigner.</p>

			<div class="body-text">
				<p>Fabiola Gianotti is an Italian experimental particle physicist, and the first woman to be Director-General at CERN in Switzerland. Since 1994 she has been a research physicist at CERN, and since August 2013 an honorary Professor at the University of Edinburgh. Dr Gianotti has worked on several CERN experiments, and been involved in detector R&D, construction, software development and data analysis.</p>
				<p>At its 195th Session, the CERN Council selected Fabiola Gianotti, as the Organization’s next Director-General. This is the first time in CERN’s history that a Director-General has been appointed for a full second term.</p>

			<div class="body-text">
				<p>Lise Meitner was an Austrian-Swedish physicist who worked on radioactivity and nuclear physics. Meitner, Otto Hahn and Otto Robert Frisch led the small group of scientists who first discovered nuclear fission of uranium when it absorbed an extra neutron. She was the first woman to become a full professor of physics in Germany.</p><p>She was invited to work on the Manhattan Project (1942–45) in the United States, but she opposed the atomic bomb, and rejected the offer.</p>
